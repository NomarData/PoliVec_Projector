# Political Vector Projector

Given word vectors trained by word2vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) or fastText (Bojanowski et al. 2016), project the vectors of U.S. senators onto a 'conservative' to 'liberal' axis. The scalar components of such projections may be interpreted as a valid metric of political ideology.

## Highlight

Plotting the vector projected ideology against [DW-NOMINATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)), an ideology metric widely used in political science, reveals a strong correlation:

In addition to members of Congress, you can also project vectors of public policies. These results are quite amusing but still highly experimental. Again, for a detailed account, please refer to [here](https://empirical.coffee/blog/2017/political-vector-projector).

## Requirements 

[fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) or [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)

[Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html) (optional, only needed for the experimental feature of projecting public policies.)

The DW-NOMINATE ideology data is available at [voteview.com](voteview.com). Some example data is already included in this repo.

I apologize that I have tested the code only with Python 3.6

## How-To

There are two methods for loading vectors into PoliVec Projector:

First Method: Use the `Word2VecProjector` class to read vector files generated by word2vec. Call `evaluate_ideology_projection()` to evaluate a single congressional session of ideology data. Call `multiyear_evaluation()` and pass an iterator, e.g. `multiyear_evaluation(cgrs_sess=range(97,115))`, to evaluate multiple years of data. The iPython notebook includes several examples that will help you get started.

Second Method: (seemingly more complicated, but more efficient for comparing multiple years of data) Provide a plain text list of words you want to query, along with the axes onto which you want to project. The axes follow the order of: `[positive x axis, negative x axis, positive y axis, negative y axis]`. An example queries.txt looks like this:
```
conservative
liberal
good
bad
johnson
nixon
carter
reagan
etc.
```
If you are interested in members of Congress, the `gen_queries.py` script in this repo can take care of this step for you. The name lists of the 95th - 114th Senate (1977 - 2017) are also already included in this repo at `queries/`

Then, run `gen_vectors.sh`, which takes multiple lists of queries and feed them to fastText's `print-word-vectors` function. Be sure to revise the directories specified in the shell script so that it loads your own pre-trained fastText models. The vectors of members of the 95th to 114th Senate are also already included in this repo at `queried_vectors/`

Lastly, create a `FastTextProjector` object to load the queried vectors, then call `evaluate_ideology_projection()` or `multiyear_evaluation()`.

(In principal, you can use PoliVec Projector with any word embedding models, so long as you make a subclass tweak the file IO methods to load your vectors properly.)
